Ved bruk av Kartverkets designbibliotek av andre organisasjoner skal den 
visuelle identiteten endres slik at det er åpenbart at produktene ikke 
tilhører Kartverket.

Som et miminum skal fargene endres, og Kartverkets logoer skal ikke 
benyttes på løsninger som ikke eies av Kartverket.

The use of the KVIB library outside of the Norwegian Mapping Authority 
is only permitted if you change the visual identity, so as to make it 
absolutely clear that your organization is not affiliated with the 
Norwegian Mapping Authority in any way.

As a minimum the colors must be changed, and the included logos should 
never be used by any organizations other than the Norwegian Mapping Authority.
